# 🍪 Cookie Sorting Game

A fun and interactive browser game designed to teach kids the concept of **variables** through hands-on play. Players sort cookies into jars based on their flavors, learning the fundamentals of randomization and assignment in a playful context.

This project was created as part of the **CLC Literary Randomizer Build (Spike Essential)** to introduce children to basic programming concepts.
